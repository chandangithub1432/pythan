Python File Example (hello.py):

python
Copy code
# This is a simple Python script
# It prints "Hello, World!" to the console

print("Hello, World!")
Python Notes:

Introduction to Python:

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity.
It is versatile and widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and more.
Running Python Code:

Python code is typically written in files with a .py extension.
To run a Python script, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the script's directory, and type python filename.py.
Variables and Data Types:

Variables are used to store data. Python supports various data types such as integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
python
Copy code
# Example:
age = 25
name = "John"
Control Flow:

Python uses indentation to define blocks of code (no braces or semicolons).
Control flow structures include if, else, elif, for, and while.
python
Copy code
# Example:
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
Functions:

Functions are reusable blocks of code. They are defined using the def keyword.
python
Copy code
# Example:
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")
greet("Alice")
Lists and Dictionaries:

Lists are ordered collections, and dictionaries are key-value pairs.
python
Copy code
# Example:
fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana"]
person = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
Modules and Libraries:

Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries and modules. You can import modules using the import keyword.
python
Copy code
# Example:
import math
print(math.sqrt(25))
Exception Handling:

Python allows you to handle exceptions using try, except, else, and finally blocks.
python
Copy code
# Example:
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero.")
File Handling:

Python supports reading from and writing to files using the open() function.
python
Copy code
# Example:
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, this is a text file.")
Documentation and Comments:

Use comments (#) for single-line comments and triple-quotes (''' or """) for multi-line comments.
python
Copy code
# This is a single-line comment

'''
This is a
multi-line comment
'''
Feel free to copy the Python file example into a file named hello.py and run it using the Python interpreter to see the output. As you progress, explore more advanced topics and projects to deepen your understanding of Python programming.
